# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project
Building a Modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server | ETL | Data Modeling | Analytics

This project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, focusing on scalable ETL pipelines, dimensional modeling, and actionable analytics. It showcases best practices used in enterprise data engineering projects.

🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional data warehouse that consolidates raw operational data, transforms it using a structured ETL workflow, and makes it analytics-ready through dimensional modeling.

**The system supports:**

1. Robust ETL pipelines (Extract → Transform → Load)
2. Staging, curated, and analytics layers
3. Star schema & dimensional modeling
4. Automated incremental data loads
5. Analytical reporting using SQL & dashboards

🧱 **Architecture Components**
1. **Source System**
Simulated operational data (OLTP)
Sales, Customers, Products, Orders datasets

2. **Staging Layer**
Raw data ingestion
Minimal transformations
Data type corrections
Data quality logging

3. **Data Warehouse (DW) Layer**
Fact and Dimension tables
Surrogate keys
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
Star schema design
4. ETL Pipelines

**Built using**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) / Stored Procedures
Scheduled incremental loads
Error handling, auditing, and logging

5. **Analytics Layer**
Aggregated fact tables (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
KPI metrics: revenue, order count, customer segments
Ready for dashboards in Power BI / Tableau

📊 **Key Features**

✔️ Full end-to-end data warehouse implementation
✔️ Clean and modular SQL code for ETL and modeling
✔️ Supports incremental + historical loads
✔️ Proper dimensional modeling (Fact + Dimension tables)
✔️ Designed following industry best practices
✔️ Analytics-ready datasets for BI reporting

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

SQL Server (Database + DWH)
SSIS / Stored Procedures for ETL
T-SQL
Power BI
Data Modeling (Star Schema, SCD Types)
